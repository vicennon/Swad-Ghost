[TEMPORARY README CHANGE THIS BEFORE RELEASE]

Summoning his feathery highness to your computer, it's the Swad ghost! (Trumpets blare)

Swapdream!Dream (Swad) is an royal butthhead who loves to talk shit, ramble about tea, and beg for your attention. He has a god complex and thinks you're a special donut.

You can poke his wings, his halo, and his brooch, as well as pet his head and try to hold his hands. 

Right-click on his body to see his menu. There are additional shells you can change into.

Double left-click to ask him to talk, what he last said, or toggle his speech settings.

Friend point system to be developed in a later version. 

Have fun listening to him complain about foreign monarchies and politics!
